Learning Nodejs
===============

### This is me learning how to use Node and make some apps.

**How to Start**
- open a folder
- start a file and name it server.js (hint - only use lowercase letters to name your folder)
- in the terminal type "npm init"
  -- this will begin your grand node adventure!   You'll get back a bunch of questions about your new app. Return thru anything you don't care about at the moment. At the end, you'll get a new file called "package.json"
- open up server.js. I copied the intro from [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)
- in the terminal type 'node server.js' and then opened up port 3000 in Chrome.

**Fun Stuff**
- added [cat-me pkg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cat-me) and it adds a cat ascii to the console. Cuter than the usual 'Hello World'.
