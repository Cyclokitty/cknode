Learning Nodejs
===============

### This is me learning how to use Node and make some apps.

**How to Start**
- open a folder
- start a file and name it server.js (hint - only use lowercase letters to name your folder)
- in the terminal type "npm init"
  -- this will begin your grand node adventure!   You'll get back a bunch of questions about your new app. Return thru anything you don't care about at the moment. At the end, you'll get a new file called "package.json"
- in the terminal type 'node server.js'
- open up server.js. I copied the intro from nodejs and then opened up port 3000 in Chrome.
